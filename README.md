# Variance-Reduction-Techniques-in-Monte-Carlo-Method---Pricing-Vanilla-Options

In the first project, I aim to compute the price of European vanilla options. In the second project, I focus on calculating their delta. Both projects use a Monte Carlo simulation. However, this method exhibits significant variance.

To address this, I employ variance reduction techniques in both projects, specifically the batch method, the practitioner method and the adaptive method. I compare the effectiveness of these methods and also analyze the convergence of my error towards zero by comparing the obtained prices and deltas with the closed-form solutions from the Black-Scholes model.
